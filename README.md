Machine learning is categorized as
 1. Supervised Learning
 2. Unsupervised Learning
 3. Reinforcement Learning 

This repository provides overview and implementation of Supervised and Unsupervised Learning

## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning involves training a model on a labeled dataset, where each input is paired with a corresponding output. The objective is to learn a mapping function from inputs to outputs based on the training data, allowing the model to make predictions on unseen data. 

-Supervised learning is used for
  1. **Classification** (e.g., object recognition)
  2. **Regression** (e.g., predicting numerical values).

### Key Characteristics:
- **Training Data**: Labeled with the correct output.
- **Objective**: Learn a function that maps inputs to outputs.


## 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised Learning deals with data that does not have labeled outputs. The goal is to explore the data and find hidden patterns, groupings, or structures. 

- Unsupervised learning does not have a target output.
- How to solve?
  1. **Clustering** (e.g., segmenting images)
  

### Key Characteristics:
- **Training Data**: Unlabeled; only input data is available.
- **Objective**: Discover underlying patterns or groupings.


## 3. Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning involves training an agent to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent learns to take actions by considering rewards and penalities.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Training Data**: Learned by interacting with environment.
- **Objective**: Learn policy is cumulative reward.
- **Applications**: Robotics (e.g., autonomous navigation), games (e.g., chess, Go).
